DSD Project 
Introduction
The Washing Machine Automatic HDL project is a hardware description language (HDL) implementation aimed at simulating and controlling a washing machine's automatic functionality. This project showcases the design and development of digital logic circuits to automate various functions of a washing machine, including water level control, motor speed regulation, timer management, and cycle sequencing.

Purpose
The primary purpose of this project is to provide a practical example of digital system design using HDLs for real-world applications. By simulating a washing machine's automatic functions, this project demonstrates how HDLs can be leveraged to create efficient and reliable control systems for complex appliances.
